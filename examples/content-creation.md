# ✍️ Example: Content Creation (LinkedIn Post)

This example shows how PROMETHEUS transforms a basic content request into a viral-worthy LinkedIn post with engineered shareability.

---

## The Task

**User Request:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post about why prompt engineering is still important even though AI models are getting smarter.
```

---

## ❌ What Most People Do (Basic Prompt)

```
Write a LinkedIn post about why prompt engineering is still important even though AI models are getting smarter. Make it engaging and shareable. Around 300 words.
```

**Problems with this approach:**
- No angle or unique perspective
- "Engaging and shareable" is too vague
- No hook strategy
- No tone specification
- No structure requirements
- No verification of quality

**Result:** Generic LinkedIn post that sounds like everyone else's hot takes.

## ✅ PROMETHEUS-Optimized Prompt

```xml
<persona>
You are a seasoned thought leader at the intersection of AI strategy and human communication—someone who has watched hype cycles rise and fall, and who sees patterns others miss. Your voice is confident but not arrogant, contrarian but grounded in evidence.
</persona>

<objective>
Craft a LinkedIn post (250-350 words) arguing that prompt engineering remains essential, using an unexpected philosophical, historical, or cross-disciplinary lens that makes readers stop scrolling and think differently.
</objective>

<context>
• Platform: LinkedIn (professional audience, saturated with AI content)
• Current narrative: Many posts declaring "prompt engineering is dead" now that AI models are smarter
• Problem: These posts get engagement through controversy but lack depth
• Your task: Reframe the entire conversation from an angle readers won't see coming
• Target audience: Business leaders, AI practitioners, knowledge workers
</context>

<requirements>
• Length: 250-350 words
• Hook (first 2 lines): Create pattern interrupt before "see more" button—counterintuitive statement, vivid micro-story, or provocative question
• Narrative arc: Structure as mini-story with tension and resolution (NOT a listicle)
• Unexpected angle: Choose ONE fresh lens (e.g., prompt engineering as Aristotelian rhetoric, as new literacy post-printing press, as jazz improvisation vs. classical composition)
• Include one line so quotable readers will screenshot it
• Tone: Warm, intelligent, slightly rebellious. No jargon. No "here's the thing" or "let me be clear"
• End with question/invitation that sparks conversation (not generic CTA)
• No hashtags in body; place 3-5 relevant hashtags at very end
</requirements>

<steps>
1. Brainstorm 3 distinct angles (one sentence each) that could reframe the debate
2. Select the most surprising and defensible angle; briefly justify your choice
3. Craft a hook that creates pattern interrupt (test: would YOU stop scrolling?)
4. Write the full post, ensuring narrative builds and insight resonates
5. Identify the most quotable line and ensure it stands alone powerfully
6. Self-critique: Review for clichés, LinkedIn-speak ("let's dive in", "here's the thing"), or weak logic. Revise any flat sections
7. Output final post only after revision
</steps>

<output>
Final LinkedIn post only. No preamble, no explanation, no labels. Just the post text ready to copy-paste, ending with hashtags.
</output>

<verification>
✓ Hook creates pattern interrupt (stops scrolling)
✓ Narrative has clear arc (not just list of points)
✓ Metaphor/angle is committed to fully (not surface-level)
✓ Includes one quotable line (screenshot-worthy)
✓ Tone avoids jargon and corporate-speak
✓ Ends with conversation starter (not generic CTA)
✓ 250-350 words
✓ Hashtags at end only

## 📝 Sample Output

Using the PROMETHEUS prompt, here's what you might get:

**Socrates never gave answers. For forty years, he only asked questions.**

Here's the profound insight: The smarter your conversational partner, the MORE your questions matter—not less.

Everyone's declaring "prompt engineering is dead" now that AI models are getting smarter. But they're missing the point entirely. When you're talking to someone brilliant, you don't ask vague questions like "tell me about life." You ask specific, thoughtful questions that draw out their expertise.

The same is true with AI.

These models are incredibly smart—which means your prompts need to be even better. Think about it: If you had 30 minutes with the world's leading expert in your field, would you walk in unprepared? Would you ask shallow questions? Of course not. You'd craft precise questions that unlock their deepest insights.

**Prompting isn't dead. It's more important than ever.**

The people who master this skill—who learn to ask the right questions, provide the right context, structure their thinking clearly—they're the ones who'll extract 10x more value from AI than everyone else.

It's not about "hacking" the AI. It's about clarity of thought. It's about knowing what you're really trying to achieve. It's about being a better thinker, not just a better prompter.

So yes, AI models are getting smarter. But that doesn't make prompting obsolete. It makes it essential.

What's your experience? Are you getting better outputs as models improve, or are you finding that clear prompting still makes all the difference?

## 💡 Content Creation Principles

### 1. Pattern Interrupt is Everything
The first 2 lines must stop the scroll. Use:
- Counterintuitive statements
- Vivid micro-stories
- Provocative questions
- Surprising statistics
- Bold declarations

### 2. Narrative Arc > Listicles
LinkedIn is saturated with "5 tips" and "3 lessons" posts. Stand out with:
- Story structure (setup, conflict, resolution)
- Tension and release
- Emotional journey
- Insight that lands

### 3. Engineer Quotability
One line should be so good people screenshot it. Characteristics:
- Stands alone without context
- Memorable phrasing
- Universal truth
- Slightly provocative

### 4. End with Genuine Curiosity
Not "What do you think?" but a specific, thoughtful question that invites real conversation.
