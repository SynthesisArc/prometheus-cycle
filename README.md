## 🎯 What Is PROMETHEUS CYCLE?

PROMETHEUS CYCLE is a **context engineering platform** that guides you through the complete lifecycle of prompt development—from initial discovery to production-ready optimization. It's not just a template; it's a **thinking partner** backed by cutting-edge research that adapts to your needs and teaches you to craft world-class prompts while you use it.

### 🆕 What's New in v4.0

**Major Evolution: From Prompt Engineering → Context Engineering**

- **Discovery Phase (Phase 0)** - Excavate the real need before building anything
- **5 Specialized Tracks** - Content, Analysis, Code, Agentic, Multimodal with domain-specific guidance
- **9 Reasoning Strategies** - Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Graph-of-Thoughts, Skeleton-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thoughts, Buffer-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Verification, Self-Consistency, Reflexion
- **Security Architecture** - Production-ready prompt injection defense, PII protection, instruction hierarchy
- **Adaptive Token Guidance** - Right-sized prompts (200-8,000 tokens) based on task complexity
- **Enhanced Model Adapters** - Concrete optimization for Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok, open-source
- **9-Criterion Evaluation Rubric** - Objective quality assessment (9/9 = production ready)
- **DSPy Integration Path** - Export for automated optimization (20-100% improvement)
- **Research-Backed** - Built on AAAI, NeurIPS, Stanford, DeepMind, Anthropic research

### The 5 Phases

```
0. DISCOVERY     → Excavate the real need before structuring
1. CREATION      → Build a crystal-clear base prompt
2. OPTIMIZATION  → Elevate with frontier tactics
3. TESTING       → Stress-test against real conditions
4. EVALUATION    → Measure quality objectively
5. DELIVERY      → Package for immediate use
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Copy the Framework

Copy the entire contents of [`prometheus-cycle-v4.0.md`](prometheus-cycle-v4.0.md)

### Step 2: Paste as System Prompt

In your LLM of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.), paste PROMETHEUS as your **system prompt** or **first message**.

### Step 3: Send Your Task

Simply describe what you want to accomplish:

```
"Write a professional email declining a meeting request"
```

or

```
"Create a LinkedIn post about AI adoption in healthcare"
```

or

```
"Build a prompt for an AI agent that triages GitHub issues"
```

### Step 4: Watch the Magic

PROMETHEUS will guide you through all 5 phases automatically, producing a production-ready prompt with:
- Discovery confirmation (`<task_type>`, `<success_looks_like>`, `<stakes>`)
- Clear structure (`<persona>`, `<objective>`, `<context>`, `<examples>`, `<requirements>`, `<reasoning_strategy>`, `<steps>`, `<output>`, `<verification>`)
- Track-specific sections (Content: `<voice>`, `<audience>` | Code: `<technical_context>`, `<edge_cases>` | etc.)
- Advanced reasoning strategies applied
- Model-specific optimization
- 9-criterion quality scoring

**That's it!** You now have a professional-grade prompt ready for production.

### Specialized Tracks

v4.0 includes 5 specialized tracks with domain-specific guidance:

1. **CONTENT TRACK** - Writing, communication, creative (`<voice>`, `<hook>`, `<audience>`, `<quotable>`)
2. **ANALYSIS TRACK** - Research, decisions, investigation (`<data_sources>`, `<methodology>`, `<confidence>`, `<so_what>`)
3. **CODE TRACK** - Development, debugging, architecture (`<technical_context>`, `<edge_cases>`, `<tests>`, `<maintainability>`)

### Reasoning Strategies

Choose the right thinking approach for your task:

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Linear step-by-step reasoning (35% fewer errors)
- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** - Explore multiple approaches, select best
- **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)** - Synthesize disparate insights (62% quality boost)
- **Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)** - Outline first, expand in parallel (2x faster)
- **Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT)** - Algorithmic search strategies (10x fewer queries)

- **Reflexion** - Learning from failure

### Model Adapters

Concrete optimization guidance for:

- **Claude** - XML-native, prefilling, `<thinking>` tags
- **GPT-4** - Literal following, sandwich method, structured outputs
- **Gemini** - Context first, anchor phrases, caching
- **Grok** - Truth-seeking, direct, less hedging
- **Open-Source** - Chat template requirements

## 💡 Quick Examples

### Example 1: Simple Content (Quick Mode)

**User:** "Write a LinkedIn post about AI adoption in healthcare"

**PROMETHEUS:**
```
Discovery confirmed: Professional LinkedIn post, healthcare AI, engaging tone.
Proceeding to creation...

[Delivers optimized prompt with <persona>, <voice>, <audience>, <output>]
```

### Example 2: Complex Agentic (Full Cycle)

**User:** "Build a prompt for an AI agent that monitors GitHub issues and suggests assignments"

**PROMETHEUS:**
```
This is a production agentic system. Discovery questions:
1. What tools does the agent have access to?
2. What's your triage criteria?
3. How should it handle uncertainty?

[After clarification, delivers full agentic prompt with security layer]
```
